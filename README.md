We have some basic commands that we can use locally or remote.

Markdown: Can be used to websites construction and is a specific type of writing

To use git we have to have something to use it with!
#BFT Big Titles use one hashtag

## Two hashtags

*italic between asterics*

** bold between two asteriscs **

/** a backwards slash before the markdown text negates the effects of the markdown effective to power!

Ordered lists:

1. ordered List
2. Second Item
* List not ordered 
	* Identention is super effective
	* Do not forget to Identation to refer to prior items!
3. Should we was a link: 
	[Link Super Descriptive! to link to SKYnet]("https://www.google.com")

| from          | the           |       |
|               | cheat list    |       |
|               |      empty    |       |

But Markdowns aren't universal

Git add [File] adds file to be uploaded!

Before adding a File we have the stagging area => file getting prepared to go up

.git is the way the computers know that it's a git folder

in stagging zone the files are in the .git folder

to up files we do git commit
